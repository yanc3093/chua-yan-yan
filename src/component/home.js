          <h3>A Bit About Myself</h3>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Sabah, Malaysia, where its rich
            biodiversity and vibrant mix of ethnic cultures shaped my
            perspective on the world, fostering a deep appreciation for
            diversity. Growing up, I developed a strong curiosity for technology
            and problem-solving, which eventually led me to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s
            degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science from Monash
            University Malaysia. After graduating, I moved to Singapore to
            kickstart my career in the tech industry as a Software Developer,
            where I have been able to apply my academic knowledge and hone my
            technical skills while contributing to impactful project. I am
            excited by the opportunities ahead in the tech world and am
            committed to continuing my growth in this ever-evolving field.
